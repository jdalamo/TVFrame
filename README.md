Smart picture frame software for a Raspberry Pi + Companion iOS app

## About
---
TVFrame is a project that emulates the functionality of a "smart" picture frame on your TV.  It's intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi connected to your TV and pictures can be emailed to it at an email specified by the user.  The companion iOS app extends this functionality by allowing the user to view the pictures saved on the device, switch modes between slideshow (where all the pictures are played) and single-photo mode (where the user can use the app to select photos to view), delete pictures from the device, and view the device's activity log.
